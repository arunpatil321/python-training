#0ne DIMINISION IN ARRAY
# One dimensional array contains elements only in one dimension.
# In other words, the shape of the NumPy array should contain
# only one value in the tuple.
# Let us see how to create 1 dimensional NumPy arrays
# import numpy as np
# # creating the list
# list = [100, 200, 300, 400]
# creating 1-d array
# n = np.array(list)
# print(n)

#2dimesional array
# Write a NumPy program to create a 2-dimensional array of size 2 x 3
# (composed of 4-byte integer elements), also print
# the shape, type and data type of the array.
# import numpy as np
# x = np.array([[2, 4, 6], [6, 8, 10]], np.int32)
# print(type(x))
# print(x)
# print(x.shape)
# print(x.dtype)

#another example
# import numpy as np
# T = [[11, 12, 5, 2], [15, 6,10], [10, 8, 12, 5], [12,15,8,6]]
# for r in T:
#    for c in r:
#       print(c,end = " ")
#    print()

#3dimensional array
# Call numpy.array(object) with object as a list containing x nested lists,
# y nested lists inside each of the x nested lists, and
# z values inside each of the y
# nested lists to create a x-by-y-by-z 3D NumPy array
# import numpy as np
# a_3d_array = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
# print(a_3d_array)

# import numpy as np
# arr1 = np.array([[[2,17], [45, 78]], [[88, 92], [60, 76]],[[76,33],[20,18]]])
# print("Create 3-d array:",arr1)
